## Features

    âœ… Video pipeline that's almost fully automated
    âœ… Gets the trending videos from selected TikTok trends or accounts
    âœ… Works around the TikTok anti-scraping mechanism to scrape and download the videos
    âœ… Generates high quality compilations, titles, descriptions and thumbnails
    âœ… Tested on multiple accounts (The accounts grew to +2.2k subs / +1,6 million views in a few weeks without any promotion)
    âœ… Uploads the videos to Youtube (Experimental)

## Demo

Here are both channels with the videos, thumbnails, descriptions, etc. that were produced with this engine:

Example video:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1HDpa5F9eo

Both channels:

- https://www.youtube.com/@diagonalley6185 (1,258,487 views - 1.6k subscribers - 11 videos)
- https://www.youtube.com/@hogwartsletter1875 (352,526 views - 664 subscribers - 11 videos)

The topic selection (Harry Potter in this case) is arbitrary. The engine can be used for any topic and niche.

## Motivation

This was a fun and messy learning project I've built quite a while ago, aiming to automate the process of creating Youtube videos with compilations as the starting point.

Why compilations? Because they are easy to produce and have a high chance of going viral. The downside is that they are not monetizable, as they are not considered original content.

I haven't updated the code in a few years, so the code quality is not the best. I'm still sharing it, as it might be useful for someone who wants to build something similar.

## Why am I not using it anymore?

It was just a fun project to learn about the Youtube algorithm and how to create viral videos. I've learned a lot and it was a great experience, but it doesn't make sense to continue with it, as it's not monetizable. (At least not in it's current form)
